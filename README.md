## Overview of the analysis:

For this project we performed an analysis working with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company.

The idea for the project is to get investors for a bike share program for the city of Des Moines like Citi Bike in New York city. For this, we are using the data that Citi Bike have published so we can analyze the data and evaluate the option of applying the program in Des Moines.

The visualizations from Tableau can be found here [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/laura8640/viz/Bike-Sharing-Story/Historia1)

## Results: 

### Analyzing the data

First, we accessed to the data from the month of August, which is one the months with more users because it is the summer, and the weather makes more pleasant to move around on a bike. Then we create our first graph, the checkout times of a ride in bike that shows us the trip duration by hours.

Now we present a graph that makes a breakdown of the checkout times by gender, like we can see in the image below:

Our third step is to present a heatmap to visualize the trips by weekday per hour, with this information we can see which time and day are the most crowded, so we can schedule the maintenance of the bikes or when to carry the bikes from one station to another depending on the demand of each day of the week.

We can also see the information described above, but with a breakdown by gender.

The fourth visualization is a heatmap that show us the most crowded trips by weekday, by gender and most important, by user type. This means which days we have most rides and who made those rides, subscriber, or customers who are the occasional users.

In addition, we crate two more graphs, a pie chart with a breakdown for the number of trips by gender and a bar chart that show us the number of rides per hour.

This info can be very valuable because it gives us the peak hours of every day. The bar chart is more specific to see the use by hour than our heatmap.

The gender pie chart tells us who are using more the bikes between men and women, and we can compare to the population of male and female numbers in Des Moines, and the numbers of NYC to know how this numbers can impact the use of bike sharing.

## Summary: 

It’s important to pay attention to the occasional users because probably Des Moines won’t have the same amount than NYC. I would suggest to analyze how is the bike use on winter, which are the similarities in the weather between the two cities to know if we can expect the same kind of use. For this I would create a visualization for specific winter months

We can also evaluate the distances that are traveled along with the trip durations and compare to the size of Des Moines and see if the people would prefer to move around in a bike. For this one I would create a map that shows the distances along with the trip duration.
